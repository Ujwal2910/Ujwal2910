### Greetings to all ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ujwal Tewari.

<br />

**I have been working in Reinforcement learning, control optimization-based techniques and multi-agent systems. In addition to this, I work in the real world deployment of AI-based models for automated control decision processes using both RL and evolutionary strategies in cases where human intervention would otherwise be difficult.**

**I have also been working as an AI Ambassador at Intel Corporation, a classroom mentor for the Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree at Udacity and a tech blogger at Medium in Analytics Vidhya.**

**Have worked in ML and Research as Applied Scientists for more than 4 years with good track record of ML papers in reputed conferences.
Expertise in model development to deployment lifecycle**
**My Interests are:**

**Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Knowledge Graphs, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision**


Here is a bit about my interests and how to get in touch:

- ðŸ’¬ I am learning about Model deployment and integration cycles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning, Dialog systems and Optimization based problems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about NLP, Deep Neural Networks, GAN, Probabilistic Models and let's Collaborate to knock new ideas to code.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ujwalkaka@gmail.com
